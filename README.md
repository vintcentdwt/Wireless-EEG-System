# Wireless-EEG-System
Using STM32F103C8T6 and ADS1299 for EEG acquisition, data is obtained through a dry electrode EEG cap. Real-time data transmission and analysis are achieved with ESP-01S and Alibaba Cloud IoT. Alpha, delta, theta, and beta waves, as well as sleep stages, are extracted to establish an abnormal sleep model differentiated by age.
